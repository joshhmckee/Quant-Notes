## 1 - Introduction to Merger Arbitrage
- Arbitrage first started in the currency markets
- Risk arbitrage and merger arbitrage
##### Modern Arbitrage Definition:
- "_The nearly simultaneous purchase and sale of securities or foreign exchange in different markets in order to profit from price discrepancies_"
- "_The purchase of the stock of a takeover target especially with a view to selling it profitably to the raider_"
##### There are three different degrees of arbitrage:
- First order: A strong, locked-in mechanical relationship in same instrument (location arbitrage)
- Second order 1: Different instruments, same underlying security (cash-future arbitrage)
- Second order 2: Different (but related) underlying securities, same instrument (volatility trading)
- Third order: Different securities, different instruments, deemed to behave in related matter (cross-market relationships)
###
- The key idea in arbitrage is the absence of risk.
- Arbitrageurs eliminate risk by taking positions that in aggregate offset each other and compensate arbitrageurs for their efforts with a profit.
###
- The type of risk for financial risk managers is beta risk and that for merger arbitrage is event risk - the event that the merger is not completed.
- Very difficult to capture event risk mathematically.
##### Much can go wrong from the announcement and its closing
- Financing for the transaction can dry up
- Antitrust can block the txn
- The econonmic environment can change making merger less appealing
- Fraud or misrepresentations discovered
###
- Potential acquirers sometimes enter into a letter of intent before signing a formal merger agreement.
- The only real merger arb occurs when the arber enters the position after a definitive agreement has been signed between the target and the acquirer.
- Book addresses transactions in which a definitive agreement has been reached.
- The upside in a merger is limited to the payment received when the merger closes. (Asymmetric payoff distribution)
- Option selling has a similar payoff distribution to merger arb.
- From an arbers point of view, the most important characteristic of a merger is the form of payment received.
##### Three main categories of mergers and one rare category:
- Cash mergers: Shareholders of target firm receive cash for their shares
- Stock-for-stock mergers: Shares of target firm are exchanged for shares of the acquirer
- Mixed stock and cash mergers: Shareholders of the target firm receive a mix of cash and share exchange
- Other considerations: Rare but may receive debt securities, spun-off divisions of target, contingent value rights etc
## 2 - The Mechanics of Merger Arbitrage
- Spread: The difference between the consideration (offer) price and the stock price.
- Spread could be negative (stock price higher than offer price) if there is speculation another cash buyer may enter and pay a higher price.
- For regulatory reasons, companies typically announce significant events like mergers prior or after regular market hours (prevent abuse from investors with better access to news)
- Merger arb has low correlation with the overall market
- A transaction at a discount to the last trading price (when announced) is called a _takeunder_
- A key component with investments is not just the return achieved but also the time needed. (more useful is the annualized return achieved)
- Can annualize returns with simple interest or compound interest
- Time: The time between when the arb trade is placed and the closing date of the merger
- Make sure yeilds are compared on similar bases
- Be careful if a dividend is to be paid during the merger period. The price of the stock may be above the merger offer for this reason. Must incorporate dividends in return calculations
- In stock-for-stock mergers, the buyer proposes to acquire a target by paying in shares rather than in cash
- The ratio of stock for stock in a stock-for-stock merger is referred to as the exchange ratio or conversion factor
- If you borrow shares from someone on an exchange and they request them back (because they want to sell), you will either have to cover and return the shares or the exchange will do that for you (if they cant find someone else to lend shares to you).
