## 1 - Introduction to Merger Arbitrage
- Arbitrage first started in the currency markets
- Risk arbitrage and merger arbitrage
##### Modern Arbitrage Definition:
- "_The nearly simultaneous purchase and sale of securities or foreign exchange in different markets in order to profit from price discrepancies_"
- "_The purchase of the stock of a takeover target especially with a view to selling it profitably to the raider_"
##### There are three different degrees of arbitrage:
- First order: A strong, locked-in mechanical relationship in same instrument (location arbitrage)
- Second order 1: Different instruments, same underlying security (cash-future arbitrage)
- Second order 2: Different (but related) underlying securities, same instrument (volatility trading)
- Third order: Different securities, different instruments, deemed to behave in related matter (cross-market relationships)
###
- The key idea in arbitrage is the absence of risk.
- Arbitrageurs eliminate risk by taking positions that in aggregate offset each other and compensate arbitrageurs for their efforts with a profit.
###
- The type of risk for financial risk managers is beta risk and that for merger arbitrage is event risk - the event that the merger is not completed.
- Very difficult to capture event risk mathematically.
##### Much can go wrong from the announcement and its closing
- Financing for the transaction can dry up
- Antitrust can block the txn
- The econonmic environment can change making merger less appealing
- Fraud or misrepresentations discovered
###
- Potential acquirers sometimes enter into a letter of intent before signing a formal merger agreement.
- The only real merger arb occurs when the arber enters the position after a definitive agreement has been signed between the target and the acquirer.
